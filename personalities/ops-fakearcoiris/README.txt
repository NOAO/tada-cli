For smoke test.
This personality like ct4m-arcoiris except does not set instrument or
telescope.  Allows "change_fits" to be run on arcoiris FITS file to
change the DTCALDAT to distant past (18xx).  Along with MARS schedule
default for the newly given bogus instrument/telescope
(bok23m/kosmos), we can force a propid on ingest that won't be in the
DB.
